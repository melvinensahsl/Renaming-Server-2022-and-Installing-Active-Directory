<h1>Overview: Lab 2 Renaming Windows Server 2022 and Installing Active Directory</h1>

In this home lab, I will be demonstrating the process of **Renaming Server 2022** and **Installing Active Directory** in a home lab environment. I'll be using   **VirtualBox** and be focusing on simulating a real-world IT setup. It serves as a practical demonstration of key IT administrative tasks, such as configuring server names, setting up Active Directory, and managing domain services.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Rename a Windows Server 2022 instance to meet organizational standards.
- Install and configure **Active Directory Domain Services** (AD DS).
- Create and manage user accounts, groups, and security policies within Active Directory.

Now that we have Windows Server 2022 set up, we can proceed with installing Active Directory on our virtual machine home lab. Before that, let's rename our computer to keep things simple. To do so, open File Explorer from the taskbar, right-click on "This PC," and select "Properties."

Proceed to log in the same way as before. Once you‚Äôve logged into your administrator account, verify the renamed computer by following the same steps: open File Explorer, click on "This PC," then "Properties," and select "Rename this PC (Advanced)." Under "Full computer name," you should now see "Server2022.‚Äù

To optimize our performance for running virtual labs more efficiently, let's go to the search bar at the bottom left, type "About your PC," and select "Advanced system settings." In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Settings..." button under the "Performance" section. In the "Performance Options" window, select "Adjust for best performance," then click "OK" to apply the changes.
